<!-- MAIN INFORMATION -->

<p id="header"> INTRODUCTION TO GOAL </p>

<p id="text"> The everlasting fight in Africa to be able to survive another day is something that you don't hear too often around your city. People are walking to work with a coffee in their hand, children walking to school to learn about their job in the future but that isn't the reality for people in Africa. Imagine how demanding it would be to carry the equivalent of a 5-year-old child for five hours or more out of each day. And some women carry, even more, up to 70 pounds in a barrel carried on the back. That's like carrying a baby hippo. This puts contraints on the people of Africa because kids cannot get a full education because of the stresses of survival, mothers are being depended on and the fathers are working trying to get every last penny in order to allow his family to live another day. This idea of people complaining about skipping lunch or not sleeping for a day is a reality for people in Africa. Poverty is also a major factor. The amount of poverty in Africa compared to North America is off the charts. The number of third world countries in Africa compared to the rest of the world is also out of this world. People live off of $1.50 - $2.50 a day, the price for a bag of chips at your local convenience store. Think about that for a second. You spend $2.50 on a bag of chips is all the money these families have for a whole day. </p> 

<p id="text"> The time to act for change is now. By clicking on the "Donate" or "Volunteer" button YOU can make a change in people's lives. The actions you take decide the survival of these families. </p>

<p id = "header"> DESCRIPTION </p>
<p id = "text"> The first figure is a representation of the total population living in extreme poverty by world region. This shows the trend of the different regions, out of all of them however Africa stands out the most. All of the other ones decrease on a downwards trend while Africa is on an upward trend. This is a problem because while everyone is getting better Africa is just adding people of the millions already in poverty. In the second figure, it shows the poverty surveys done. As you can see, there is very little red/orange in any other region other than Africa. Africa has such a big population in poverty, that there is barely any reports on poverty. There simply are too many to count. In the third figure, we take an in-depth view of the percentage to clean water by country in Africa. As you can see, there are many countries filled in with red which shows risk in the purity of the water. This causes risk such as water disease. The continent is split almost 50% to 50% and that just isn't the standard that all the other continents deal with. The problem and issue in Africa have shown that it isn't getting better but instead of getting worse. Actions need to be taken. </p>
