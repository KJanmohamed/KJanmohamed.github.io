          <input class = "center" type="submit" value="Stage 1 Site" />
      </form>


        <td>In this stage, I created a template and set the title to the page. This was done at the start of the unit and I benefited from doing this because it taught me about the HTML template. This will help me at all aspects about HTML because this template is the starting point to any file.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stage 2</td>

      </form>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, I started to understand how to create a flip box. I created the first goal of the UN Sustainability Goals - No Poverty - and added text to the back so when the user hovers over the goal it presents a qfuestion. I also created a button that brings the user back to the home page.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stage 3</td>

      </form>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, I created 17 flip boxes and ordered them vertically with unique questions on the back about that certain goal. I also set the size to 300px, and set the background colour as well. This specifically helps me understand the background information about flip boxes so when it comes to me creating a flip box website the process is easier to understand.</td>

          <input class = "center" type="submit" value="Stage 4 Site" />
      </form>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, I created a background template that allowed the website to have 17 white boxes, each containing a goal regarding the UN Sustainability with a background colour of blue. This also allowed us to set a feature so if the user decided to shorten the screen the goals would rearrange itself into rows of 3, 2 or 1. This will help my webpage regarding my flip boxes with questions and answers. It will help my webpage look visually appealing.</td>

          <input class = "center" type="submit" value="Stage 5 Site" />
      </form>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, I created a website with a header of the UN Sustainability goals and when the webpage is shortened, the header changes as well. Everything else stayed the same. This will help my website, specifically my website regarding flip boxes because it helps improve user accesibility and it visually looks appealing.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Stage 6</td>

          <input class = "center" type="submit" value="Stage 6 Site" />
      </form>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, I created a div that allowed the user to scroll down the website, but the header stayed on the top of the page. This will help my website because if I decide to use a header with the different websites that I have created, I would like to keep that at the top to help increase the user efficiancy.</td>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, we set up the javascript section of this specific website. Javascript is needed in my website because it allows for dynamic information to be implemented in the website and some specific fine differences.</td>

        <td>In this stage, I checked if I had JQuery. JQuery is important to the development of my website because it acts as a library that I can pull ideas out of. This is important because as a coder, just starting off, I need that resource to achieve what I want.</td>

        <td>In this stage, we actually understand how to utilise this data efficiantly, including how to access the console. This is always useful as you can see your code on the website using the "command" "i" in combination to help access the index. Specifically in this stage we had accessed the Albania data but if I were to use the data pulled, I could access anything using the code " console.log(data.fact[(desired country number)].dims.COUNTRY) ".</td>

        <td>For this stage, I learned how to manipulate strings and how to use those string information to complete math. This helped me realize the endless possibilites that can be accomplished with string manipulation. This is useful to my website because I do intend to use graphs and specifically the use of information of country sanitation percent and compare that to african countries. This would be completed in a table such as the one shown on the websites to the left.</td>
